# AndroidRobint

This is an Android version of a project that I had developed during my Bachelor's degree in Information System, and was used as my final project. The idea is a chatbot to help users with programming logic related questions (the chatbot functionalities are not implemented yet).

But this project can be used as a base for the development of future projects.
